# Celestial Reverie

This is a C++ project with Qt + OpenGL for simulating the movement of celestial bodies in space. 

This project provides a base class for celestial bodies, a base class for update algorithms, and a base class for simulation algorithms, allowing the switching of different algorithms through template functions during simulation. It is easy to implement diverse celestial bodies and algorithms by inheriting the base classes. 

The library includes two types of celestial bodies: planets and stars; two update methods: forward Euler and implicit Euler; two simulation algorithms: brute-force and Barnes-Hut, along with parallel versions of these algorithms. Additionally, the library offers collision detection and celestial body merging functions based on octrees.

## Environment Setup

This project is developed using Qt Creator 5.0.2 (Qt 5.15.2 with MSVC 2019, 64-bit).  
Open the ```CelestialReverieLib.pro``` file in Qt Creator, and click ```Build``` in the lower-left corner to compile the Celestial simulation library. The compiled library file ```libCelestialReverieLib.a``` should be placed manually in the lib directory. This step has already been completed in the project.  
After completing the previous step, open the ```CelestialReverie.pro``` file in Qt Creator and click ```Build``` in the lower-left corner to compile and run the project. This compilation depends on the library file generated in the previous step. If you prefer not to use the encapsulated library file, you can manually edit the ```CelestialReverie.pro``` file and add the five files from ```src/simulation``` to the ```SOURCES``` variable.

## GUI Manual

![Celestial Reverie](resource/Screenshot.png)

This project uses Qt + OpenGL to interface with the celestial simulation library, providing a simple graphical user interface.  
- The ```File``` menu allows for saving and loading celestial systems.  
- The ```Simulation``` menu enables switching between different simulation algorithms.  
- The ```Update``` menu allows selecting the update algorithm and adjusting the time step.  
- The ```Collision``` menu toggles the collision merging feature for celestial bodies.  
- Clicking the ```Pause/Resume``` button will pause or resume the simulation.  
- Dragging the progress bar below allows for time jumping.  
- While the simulation is running, clicking on the rendering component with the mouse will switch to free camera view. In this mode, dragging the mouse will rotate the camera's viewpoint.  
- Pressing ```W/S/A/D/C/Space``` will move the camera forward, backward, left, right, up, or down.  
- Holding the ```Alt``` key will bring up the mouse cursor.  
- The green line on celestial bodies points in the direction of the net force they experience.

This project is inspired by [this guide](https://learnopengl-cn.github.io/07%20PBR/02%20Lighting/) and implements a basic version of Physics-Based Rendering. However, due to time constraints, features like ray collision detection and reflections were not implemented. Additionally, it incorporates the dynamic texture effect for the surface of stars, inspired by [this shader](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/dd2Xzm).
